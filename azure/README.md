```
# ph_password
# password to access the pihole webui

# mgmt_cidr
# an IP range granted webUI, EC2 SSH access. Also permitted PiHole DNS if dns_novpn = 1 (default).
# deploying from home? This should be your public IP address with a /32 suffix. 

# ssh_key
# A public SSH key for access to the compute instance via SSH, with user ubuntu.
```

# Deploy
```
# Clone and change to directory
git clone https://github.com/chadgeary/cloudblock && cd cloudblock/azure/

# Initialize terraform
